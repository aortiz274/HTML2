	<p>My name is Alex. I am a tranfer student from UTSA. I found out about the program here at North West Vista through a friend of mine who got me into the creative media field. I started out taking picture and shooting some video but I really wanted to expand my knowledge in this field. I am a first time mom and I absolutley love spending time with my boyfriend and baby boy. I am aslo a part time employee with H-E-B in the floral department.  </p>

	<h3><i>&#8594;H-E-B Florist</i></h3>
	<p>I have been with <b>H-E-B</b> for 8 years and I really enjoy my job. I work in a department where I get the oppritunity to be creative. I know it sounds like I'm hyping my work but I love when I make something for a customer and they walk away truly satisfied with what I've created for them. </p>

	<p>When I found out I was going to be a mom, I dropped everything I was doing to focus on prepairing for my son. My son was born on December 3, 2018 and I have been trying to be the best mom for him. I have a very supportive boyfriend who helps me out immensly. </p>
