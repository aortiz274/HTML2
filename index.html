	<h2>H-E-B Florist</h2>
		
	<p>I have been with <b>H-E-B</b> for 8 years and I really enjoy my job. I work in a department where <br> I get the oppritunity to be creative. I know it sounds like I'm hyping my work but I love when <br> I make something for a customer and they walk away so happy with what I've created for them. </p>

			<h2>MUSIC!!</h2>
		<p> I love music! Music for me is like therapy, it can make me feel strong, when I feel weak, or happy when I'm sad. It can uplift me when I need it to, and remind me of who I am. Its a peice of me that is unique. It's like style, everyone has different taste and I think it can really explain a lot about a person without telling too much. Here are some of my favorite bands and artist. 
			
			<aside> 
				
				<h4>Dance Gavin Dance</h4>
				
				<p>Dance Gavin Dance is my number 1! I have been a fan of them since I was in middle school. They are definetly a band I can jam at least once a day. </p>
					 
					 
				
				<h4>Title Fight</h4>
				
				<p>Title Fight is another band I can listen to at least once a day. They are what the you call "pop punk". Which means they are just a popular punk band like Blink 182 or Greenday but they're heavier. </p>
