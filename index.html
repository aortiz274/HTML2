		<h2>This is me...</h2></div>
		
	<p>My name is Alex. I am a tranfer student from UTSA. I found out about the program here <br>
at North West Vista through a friend of mine who got me into the creative media field. <br> I started out taking pictures and shooting some video but I really wanted to expand my <br> knowledge in this field. I am a first time mom and I absolutley love spending time with my <br> boyfriend and baby boy. I am aslo a part time employee with H-E-B in the floral department.</p>
